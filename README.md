# StringType

A String library for Amiga, written in C.

This project is mainly for fun, but I do intend to build a String type that I
can use in future projects.  The library will keep growing as I think of more
string functions to add; many are currently missing.

I am currently using [Manx Aztec C 5.0a](https://www.aztecmuseum.ca/compilers.htm#amiga)
to build the test runner, using `make test`.  I have plans to improve the test
runner, including extracting the test functions into separate source files.
